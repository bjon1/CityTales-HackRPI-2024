## Inspiration

We were inspired by the untold stories of cities around the world and the chance to reconnect people with their urban surroundings. We wanted to build a tool that turns a simple walk into an exploration of hidden histories, giving users a deeper appreciation of their city and a way to support local culture and heritage.
What it does

## What it does

CityTales reveals fascinating historical facts and stories tied to specific locations in your city. Users can explore different landmarks, check in at places, and unlock new stories as they go. By tracking each visit, users can create a unique journey through their city’s past, gaining insights and building a personal connection to their surroundings.
How we built it

## How we built it

We built CityTales using the Google Maps API to identify and guide users to significant locations, with historical data and images sourced from Wikipedia and Claude AI.
Challenges we ran into

## Challenges we ran into

One challenge we tackled was managing Python imports and coordinating multiple APIs smoothly. With each API—Google Maps, Wikipedia, and Claude AI—requiring specific handling, we had to carefully manage dependencies and data flows. This process was intricate, as we needed each service to work together seamlessly to deliver accurate, location-based stories to users in real time. The challenge pushed us to get creative with our setup, and we ended up with a streamlined, powerful integration that fuels the storytelling experience behind CityTales.
